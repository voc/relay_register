# relay register

## Usage

### Register new relay

Sending data to `/register` to register a new relay can be done with curl

```
curl -k -H "CONTENT-TYPE: application/json" -d "{"iv":"1231234345354", "data":{â€¦}}"
```

or use the ruby client in examples folder.

The API expects the following object resources in JSON format:

```
{
  "iv": "iv",
  "data": {
    "api_key": "api_key",
    "raw_data": {
      "hostname": "#{`hostname -f`}",
      "lspci": "#{`lspci`}",
      "ip_config": "#{`ip a`}",
      "disk_size": "#{`df -h`}",
      "memory": "`#{free -m`}",
      "cpu": "#{File.read('/proc/cpuinfo')}"
    }
  }
}
```

`data` needs to be `AES-256-CBC` encrypted and Base64 encoded.
